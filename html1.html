			   <b>N</b>o, I'm not one of those fashionistas that believe in dividing the shoppers between 
			   two categories: <i>the winter ones</i>, and <i>the summer ones</i>. Simply put, within every season,
			   we wear the ones which compliment our current fashion style, or are a fun addition to it.<br><br>
			
			   My personal obsession with this fashion piece is so huge, that I would break the <b><i>unwritten
			   rules</i></b> of weather seasons any time. I am a personal believer in the fact that it is impossible
			   to have enough shoppers in your closet.<br><br>
			   
			   Every season, on the popular brand-store shelves new shopper models appear, which preocupy my
			   attention and spark a desire to go and "clean" my closet-space, in order to make room for those
			   brand-new models. This tradition continues this fall as well, so in the tireless search for the
			   prettiest shopper models, I have decided to sniff through the websites of everyone's favourite 
			   brands.<br><br>
			   
			   I made a selection of 3 fabulous purses for you and only you, which will become the new favourite 
			   member of your closet. On my list there are several leather shoppers, in multiple colors (among 
			   which there is a classic black, cognac and brown, typical fall colors you could say), and the ones 
			   decorated with super-popular snake-like and pearly patterns!<br></p>
